                    <h2>Nikola Tesla</h2>
                    <p>(10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943)</p>
                    <p>A Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, 
                        mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for 
                        his contributions to the design of the modern alternating 
                        current (AC) electricity supply system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering 
                        and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical 
                        experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental 
                        Edison in the new electric power industry.
                    <p>
                        In 1884 he emigrated to the 
                        United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a 
                        short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck 
                        out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, 
                        Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of 
                        electrical and mechanical devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His alternating current (AC) induction 
                        motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric 
                        in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone 
                        of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.

                    <h2>Nikola Tesla v/s Thomas Edison</h2>
                    <p>Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison are two giants of 
                        electrical engineering whose inventions changed history. 
                        But the electricity between the two is no secret to the world.</p>
                    <p>Tesla went to work on the task and spent over 
                        a year greatly improving Edison's design and 
                        added features of his own. When he went to collect 
                        the money owed to him, Edison replied “Tesla, 
                        you don't understand our American humor”. Tesla 
                        then resigned from working for Edison over a 
                        dispute in pay of $25 per week.</p>

                    <h2>Tragic End Of Inventions And Life</h2>
                    <p>In 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, destroying years’ 
                        worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado 
                        Springs for two years, returning to New York in 1900. 
                        He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began 
                        building a global communications network centered on a 
                        giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds 
                        ran out and Morgan balked at Tesla’s grandiose schemes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working 
                        on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded. 
                        His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing 
                        were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius. He spent 
                        his final years feeding—and, he claimed, communicating with—the city’s pigeons.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943.</p>
